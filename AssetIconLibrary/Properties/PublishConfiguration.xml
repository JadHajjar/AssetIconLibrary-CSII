# Asset Icon Library
Add thumbnails to all of the game's assets and region packs!

From props, to buildings, and brands' billboards and signs. Add over **27'000 thumbnails** to your game, and counting!


## A community effort.
The thumbnail initiative was a collaborative project organised by TDW and Sully. Asset Icon Library wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the kind individuals who volunteered their time to help us screenshot the entire asset roster, they really did an incredible job. So a big thank you to everyone who was involved!

Dev team: Harbourmaster Jay, Dome, Chameleon TBN, Tigon Ologdring

Volunteers: Dushess, TheBusStop, LeoLegal, Sacavain, JouleThief, Bagi, StarQ, ShelleySkylines, HH_Afterdark, Skilzthatkilz11, BakerBytes 


## Where will I see the thumbnails?
Asset Icon Library populates the assets' icons in:
* The vanilla toolbars
* The "Add Object" menu
* Find It!
* Any mod that makes use of asset thumbnails.


## Can I add my own thumbnails?
In Asset Icon Library's settings page, you can open the "Custom Thumbnails Folder" where you can add your own thumbnails which are then automatically used in-game.

This allows you to add your own thumbnails without needing to overwrite any file in the mod itself, where your thumbnails could be lost on the next mod update.
